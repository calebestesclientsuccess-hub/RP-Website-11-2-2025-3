## Stage 3.1: Split Scene Refinement Prompt (buildSplitScenePrompt)

```
You are refining a SPLIT scene (side-by-side layout) for maximum cinematic impact.

CURRENT SCENE CONFIGURATION:
${JSON.stringify(scene, null, 2)}

AVAILABLE CONTENT CATALOG:
${JSON.stringify(catalog, null, 2)}

REFINEMENT GOALS:
1. **Layout Balance**: Ensure left/right content creates visual harmony
2. **Transition Design**: Entry/exit effects should work in tandem (staggered reveals)
3. **Typography Hierarchy**: Heading size must dominate, body size supports
4. **Media Presentation**: If using image/video, ensure mediaPosition/mediaScale/mediaOpacity are optimal

SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:

**ANIMATION CHOREOGRAPHY:**
- Use staggerChildren (0.2-0.4s) to reveal left → right or vice versa
- Entry effects should be directional (slide-left for left content, slide-right for right)
- Exit effects should mirror entry (maintain visual flow)

**VISUAL COMPOSITION:**
- If one side has media, ensure mediaOpacity complements text contrast
- Background color should not compete with media (use darker bg if media is bright)
- Text alignment: "left" for left content, "right" for right content (or both "center")

**SCROLL EFFECTS:**
- Avoid scaleOnScroll on split scenes (creates imbalance)
- Use subtle parallaxIntensity (0.2-0.3) for depth, not drama
- fadeOnScroll can work if both sides fade symmetrically

**MANDATORY VALIDATION:**
- All 37 director controls must have values
- Ensure no conflicts (parallax + scale, blur + parallax)
- Durations must be ≥ 1.2s for noticeable choreography

Return the refined scene JSON with complete director config.

**AUDIT:**
✅ Matches source code exactly
✅ All refinement goals present
✅ Validation requirements included
✅ No inconsistencies detected
## Stage 3.2: Gallery Scene Refinement Prompt (buildGalleryScenePrompt)

```
You are refining a GALLERY scene (multi-image grid) for maximum visual impact.

CURRENT SCENE CONFIGURATION:
${JSON.stringify(scene, null, 2)}

AVAILABLE CONTENT CATALOG:
${JSON.stringify(catalog, null, 2)}

REFINEMENT GOALS:
1. **Staggered Reveals**: Use staggerChildren (0.1-0.3s) for sequential image appearance
2. **Grid Motion**: Entry effects should work as a wave (top-to-bottom or left-to-right)
3. **Unified Exit**: All images should exit together (no stagger on exit)
4. **Scroll Interaction**: Galleries benefit from scaleOnScroll (subtle zoom as user scrolls)

SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:

**ANIMATION ORCHESTRATION:**
- entryEffect: "fade" or "zoom-in" works best for grids
- entryDuration: 1.5-2.0s (slower than single images for dramatic reveal)
- staggerChildren: 0.15-0.25s (creates wave effect across 4-6 images)
- exitEffect: "fade" or "dissolve" (quick, unified exit at 1.0s)

**VISUAL HARMONY:**
- backgroundColor should contrast with images (dark bg for light images)
- mediaScale: "cover" ensures all images fill grid cells uniformly
- mediaOpacity: 1.0 (full opacity for galleries, no transparency)
- alignment: "center" (galleries are inherently centered)

**SCROLL CHOREOGRAPHY:**
- scaleOnScroll: true (subtle zoom creates depth)
- parallaxIntensity: 0 (conflicts with scale, avoid)
- fadeOnScroll: false (galleries should remain visible)
- scrollSpeed: "normal" or "fast" (galleries are scan-heavy)

**MANDATORY VALIDATION:**
- Verify all 37 controls present
- Ensure staggerChildren matches number of images (0.15s × 6 images = 0.9s total reveal)
- Durations: entry ≥ 1.5s, exit ≥ 1.0s

Return the refined scene JSON with complete director config.
```

**AUDIT:**
✅ Matches source code exactly
✅ Stagger calculation guidance included
✅ Grid-specific controls addressed
✅ No inconsistencies detected
## Stage 3.3: Quote Scene Refinement Prompt (buildQuoteScenePrompt)

```
You are refining a QUOTE scene (testimonial/social proof) for maximum emotional impact.

CURRENT SCENE CONFIGURATION:
${JSON.stringify(scene, null, 2)}

AVAILABLE CONTENT CATALOG:
${JSON.stringify(catalog, null, 2)}

REFINEMENT GOALS:
1. **Contemplative Pacing**: Slow, deliberate entry/exit (2.5s+ durations)
2. **Typographic Emphasis**: Large heading size (6xl-8xl), elegant body size (lg-xl)
3. **Minimal Distractions**: No scroll effects, no parallax, pure focus on words
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Cross-fade entry/exit for cinematic feel

SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:

**ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY:**
- entryEffect: "fade" or "cross-fade" (gentle, respectful entrance)
- entryDuration: 2.5-3.0s (allow words to sink in)
- entryEasing: "power3" or "power4" (cinematic deceleration)
- exitEffect: "dissolve" or "cross-fade" (elegant, blurred exit)
- exitDuration: 2.0-2.5s (slightly faster than entry, but still slow)

**TYPOGRAPHIC CONTROL:**
- headingSize: "7xl" or "8xl" (quote text dominates viewport)
- bodySize: "xl" or "2xl" (author/role text is secondary but readable)
- fontWeight: "semibold" for quote, "normal" for author
- alignment: "center" (quotes are inherently centered)

**VISUAL STILLNESS:**
- backgroundColor: Solid color, no gradients (avoid distraction)
- textColor: High contrast with background (#ffffff on #0a0a0a)
- parallaxIntensity: 0 (no motion, quotes are static moments)
- scaleOnScroll: false (no zoom)
- fadeOnScroll: false (no fade)
- blurOnScroll: false (no blur)

**MANDATORY VALIDATION:**
- All 37 controls present
- No scroll effects enabled (quotes are contemplative pauses)
- Durations: entry ≥ 2.5s, exit ≥ 2.0s
- Ensure textShadow: false, textGlow: false (clean, minimalist)

Return the refined scene JSON with complete director config.
```

**AUDIT:**
✅ Matches source code exactly
✅ Contemplative philosophy emphasized
✅ All scroll effects explicitly disabled
✅ No inconsistencies detected
## Stage 3.4: Fullscreen Scene Refinement Prompt (buildFullscreenScenePrompt)

```
You are refining a FULLSCREEN scene (immersive media takeover) for maximum cinematic impact.

CURRENT SCENE CONFIGURATION:
${JSON.stringify(scene, null, 2)}

AVAILABLE CONTENT CATALOG:
${JSON.stringify(catalog, null, 2)}

REFINEMENT GOALS:
1. **Immersive Entry**: Dramatic zoom-in or dissolve (2.5s+ duration)
2. **Media Presentation**: Ensure mediaPosition/mediaScale create intended focal point
3. **Scroll Depth**: Use parallax or scale for depth perception
4. **Bold Exit**: Fast, aggressive exit (zoom-out, scale-blur) to transition to next scene

SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:

**ANIMATION DRAMA:**
- entryEffect: "zoom-in", "blur-focus", or "spiral-in" (dramatic reveals)
- entryDuration: 2.5-3.5s (hero-level timing)
- entryEasing: "power4" (cinematic deceleration)
- exitEffect: "zoom-out", "scale-blur", or "dissolve" (fast, aggressive)
- exitDuration: 1.5-2.0s (faster than entry for punch)

**MEDIA MASTERY:**
- mediaPosition: "center" (default), or "top"/"bottom" if focal point requires
- mediaScale: "cover" (full bleed, no letterboxing)
- mediaOpacity: 1.0 (fullscreen media is 100% opaque)
- backgroundColor: #0a0a0a (dark fallback if media doesn't load)

**SCROLL CHOREOGRAPHY:**
- parallaxIntensity: 0.4-0.6 (moderate depth, creates immersion)
- scaleOnScroll: false if parallax > 0 (avoid conflict)
- blurOnScroll: true (optional, for 1-2 fullscreen scenes max)
- scrollSpeed: "slow" (cinematic, deliberate scrolling)

**OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
- enablePerspective: true if using rotate-in/flip-in effects
- backdropBlur: "none" (media should be sharp, not blurred)
- mixBlendMode: "screen" or "overlay" if you want media to blend with background

**MANDATORY VALIDATION:**
- All 37 controls present
- Ensure parallax + scale conflict resolved (one must be 0/false)
- Durations: entry ≥ 2.5s, exit ≥ 1.5s
- mediaOpacity must be 1.0 for fullscreen

Return the refined scene JSON with complete director config.
