To impress a future technical co-founder while getting to users fast, you need to demonstrate architectural maturity without getting bogged down in implementation drudgery.A strong technical co-founder will be more impressed by what you chose not to build (because it shows strategic prioritization) than by a fully fleshed-out but mediocre CRUD app.Here is the comprehensive list of specific changes to scale down to a "High-Fidelity Core / Low-Fidelity Shell" prototype.1. The "Magical" Core (Over-Develop This)This is the 20% of the app that must feel like magic. It proves the thesis.A. The "Director" Brain (Pre-Seeded Intelligence)Change: Stop building the "Scene Template" management UI (Cygnus Phases 1 & 2).The Hack: Instead of a database of user-generated templates, creating a hardcoded SystemLibrary.ts file containing 15-20 perfectly coded, high-end GSAP animations (Hero, Grid, Scroll-Text, Video Reveal).Why: It guarantees the AI always picks a winner. No risk of user-generated garbage breaking the demo. It makes the AI look smarter than it is.Tech Flex: Shows the co-founder you understand "Parametric Composition" (Data separating from Rendering) without wasting time on CRUD forms.B. The "Brand DNA" InjectionChange: Don't build a complex "Brand Settings" dashboard with logo uploads and croppers.The Hack: In the Wizard, offer 5 curated "Brand Archetypes" (e.g., "Cyberpunk," "Swiss Minimal," "Corporate Blue"). Or, simple Color Pickers.The Polish: Ensure the SceneRenderer strictly enforces these variables via CSS Variables (var(--primary)).Why: It proves the "Brand Physics" concept works immediately without needing users to upload their own assets perfectly.C. The "Storyscroll" Engine (The Renderer)Change: Don't build edge-case handling for every possible screen size yet.The Hack: Optimize specifically for Desktop/Laptop widths. Add a simple "Mobile Coming Soon" overlay on phones.The Polish: Spend your time refining the GSAP triggers (scrub speeds, entrance animations). This visual fluidity is what sells the dream.2. The "Shell" (Severely Under-Develop This)These are features that are "solved problems" in software engineering. A future CTO knows they can build these later; they don't need to see them now.A. Multi-Tenancy & AuthChange: Cut Clerk or complex JWT auth integration. Cut the tenants table strict enforcement logic.The Hack: Hardcode a Single Tenant ID (demo_tenant_01) into the API client.The Flow: User lands on the site -> Clicks "Try Demo" -> Goes straight to the Wizard. No login required.Why: Removes friction for early testers. Captures value faster.B. The Media Library (DAM)Change: Scrap the "Media Manager" UI, uploads, and "Orphan cleanup" logic.The Hack:Stock Integration: Use the Unsplash API for images.Direct Links: Allow users to paste a URL for their logo.Why: Building a file manager is tedious. Using Unsplash makes the generated sites look beautiful by default (solving the "ugly user content" problem).C. The Project DashboardChange: Don't build a table with sorting, filtering, folders, or analytics.The Hack: A simple grid of "Your Recent Projects" stored in localStorage or a simple cookie.Why: You don't need project management yet. You need creation.D. Hosting & PublishingChange: Do not build the "Publish to Custom Domain" or "Export Code" pipeline.The Hack: The "Live Preview" is the product. Give them a shareable link (e.g., app.revenueparty.com/preview/xyz-123).Why: Dealing with DNS records and Vercel API deployments is a massive distraction.3. The Revised User Journey (The "Happy Path")Step 1: The "Hook" (Wizard)Old Plan: Multi-step wizard saving to DB at every step.New Plan: One Single Form.Left Side: "Paste your Essay/Notes here."Right Side: "Choose your Vibe (Brand Archetype)."Action: Big glowing "Generate" button.Step 2: The "Prestige" (Generation)Old Plan: Loading spinner while backend processes.New Plan: Streaming UI. Show the AI "thinking" steps (e.g., "Analyzing Sentiment...", "Selecting Hero Component...", "Applying Brand Physics...").Why: It masks latency (since we aren't optimizing tokens yet) and makes the system feel intelligent.Step 3: The "Director" (Editing)Old Plan: Full JSON Editor + Chat.New Plan: Chat Only. Hide the JSON code behind a "Dev Mode" toggle (for the co-founder to see). The user only interacts via chat ("Make the headline punchier").Why: Keeps the user in the "Director" role, not the "Developer" role.Summary of "Cuts" vs. "Keeps"FeatureStatusStrategyScene Templates DBCUTReplace with hardcoded SystemLibrary.ts (perfect quality control).Auth / LoginCUTReplace with "Guest Mode" / Hardcoded Tenant.Media UploadsCUTReplace with Unsplash API + URL Pasting.Export / PublishCUTReplace with Shareable Preview Link.GSAP AnimationKEEPPolish this. This is the "wow" factor.AI Prompt LogicKEEPPolish this. The "Assembler" logic must be smart.Optimistic UIKEEPPolish this. The chat updates must feel instant.Schema DesignKEEPKeep the SQL schema files clean (for the co-founder to respect), even if the API bypasses some checks.
