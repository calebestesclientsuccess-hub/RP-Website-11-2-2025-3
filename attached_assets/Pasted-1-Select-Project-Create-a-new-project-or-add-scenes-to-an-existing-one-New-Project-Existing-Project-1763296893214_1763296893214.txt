I've adjusted the transitions across all scenes to create a more dramatic and cinematic narrative arc. Here’s a summary of the changes:

*   **Nostalgic Opening (Scenes 1-8):** I've refined the transitions to use slower, more deliberate fades and dissolves, enhancing the feeling of a fond memory. The exit from this section is now quicker to create a sharp contrast with the corporate world that follows.

*   **Intense Middle Section (Scenes 9-14):** The fast, jarring slide and zoom effects are maintained to reflect a demanding corporate environment. I've then slowed the pacing right down for the introspective quote, 'the voice wasn't mine,' allowing that moment of realization to land with more weight.

*   **Pivotal Turn (Scenes 15-18):** The transition into the artist's introspection is now a slower zoom, pulling the viewer into the moment of decision. The reveal of 'So I built my own table' remains a powerful, slow fade.

*   **Confident Finale (Scenes 19-24):** The brand reveal and final collection now use more impactful zoom and fade effects with longer durations, giving them a bold, premium, and cinematic feel. The final quote lingers, leaving a lasting impression.
