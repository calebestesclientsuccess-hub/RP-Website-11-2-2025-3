Build New "Bouncy GTM Branding Page"
Project Goal: We are building a new, top-level portfolio page for our branding services. This page will be at the /branding route.

The primary user experience will be an interactive, "in-grid expansion" portfolio. The user will see a grid of project cards. When a card is clicked, the grid itself will "open up" to reveal a detailed case study, pushing the other cards down.

The animations must be "bouncy, 3D, and alive," using Framer Motion's spring physics.

1. Page Architecture & Hero
New Route: Create a new page component at the /branding route.

Navigation: Add a new link named "Branding" to the main website navigation bar that points to /branding.

Page Layout: This page will have a simple two-part layout:

Hero Section: A text-based hero at the top.

Portfolio Grid: The interactive project grid directly below it.

Hero Component (<BrandingHero />):

The hero is simple and text-focused.

The <h1> headline must be this exact copy: "Your Brand Is Driving Sales, Or Killing Them."

2. Component: <ProjectGrid /> (The Controller)
This component will fetch the project data and manage the core logic.

Data: Import the projects array from /data/projects.js (see section 5 for the data structure).

State: Use useState to manage the currently open project:

const [expandedId, setExpandedId] = useState(null);

Toggle Logic: The onClick handler passed to each card should toggle the state:

const handleToggle = (projectId) => { setExpandedId(expandedId === projectId ? null : projectId); };

Grid Layout:

Use Tailwind CSS grid (e.g., grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8).

Map over the projects array.

Crucially: You must render both the card and the expansion component inside the map and wrap them in a React.Fragment. This is to ensure the expansion panel appears in the correct place in the grid.

JavaScript

// <ProjectGrid />
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
  {projects.map(project => (
    <React.Fragment key={project.id}>
      <ProjectCard
        project={project}
        onClick={() => handleToggle(project.id)}
      />
      <AnimatePresence>
        {expandedId === project.id && (
          <ProjectExpansion project={project} />
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </React.Fragment>
  ))}
</div>
3. Component: <ProjectCard /> (The Trigger)
This is the clickable card in the grid.

Component: Must be a motion.div.

Content: Display project.thumbnailImage, project.clientName, and project.projectTitle.

Aesthetics:

Shape: "Soft and rounded." Use rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl.

Shadow: "Deep and heavy." Use shadow-xl and increase it on hover, e.g., transition-shadow duration-300 hover:shadow-2xl.

Animation (Bouncy & 3D):

layout Prop: This is mandatory. Add the layout prop to the motion.div. This is what makes the other cards "shuffle" smoothly.

whileHover Prop: Use this to create the 3D "pop" effect.

whileHover={{ scale: 1.03, rotateZ: '1deg' }}

transition Prop: All animations must use type: "spring" to be "bouncy."

transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 20 }}

JavaScript

// <ProjectCard />
<motion.div
  layout
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.03, rotateZ: '1deg' }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 20 }}
  onClick={onClick}
  className="cursor-pointer rounded-2xl shadow-xl overflow-hidden"
>
  {/* ...card content (image, title) */}
</motion.div>
4. Component: <ProjectExpansion /> (The Payload)
This is the component that opens up to show the case study. It must be styled to span the full width of the grid.

Spanning Logic: This component will render in the grid flow after its corresponding card. You must use Tailwind's grid-column: span / full (or equivalent) to make it break out of its single-column constraint and span the entire width of the grid (e.g., md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3).

Component: Must be a motion.div.

Animation (The "Roll-Open"):

It must have initial, animate, and exit props to animate its height and opacity.

initial={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}

animate={{ opacity: 1, height: 'auto' }}

exit={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}

transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 30 }}

Content (The "Story"):

This component receives the full project object.

Layout: Use a clean, two-column layout within this component.

Column 1 (The Story):

<h3>The Challenge</h3> -> project.challenge

<h3>The Solution</h3> -> project.solution

<h3>The Outcome</h3> -> project.outcome

<blockquote> -> project.testimonial.text

Column 2 (The Assets):

A horizontally scrolling gallery for project.galleryImages.

Primary CTA:

Place a single, prominent button at the bottom of the content.

Exact Text: "Schedule a Brand Diagnostic & Strategy Session"

5. Data Structure (/data/projects.js)
Create this file. This structure is the single source of truth for the page and must contain all fields needed for the <ProjectExpansion /> component.

JavaScript

export const projects = [
  {
    id: 1,
    clientName: "Client A",
    projectTitle: "Full GTM Rebrand",
    thumbnailImage: "/images/portfolio/client-a-thumb.jpg",
    categories: ["Branding", "Strategy", "Web Design"],
    
    // For the <ProjectExpansion />
    challenge: "Client A was a new B2B SaaS player struggling to differentiate itself in a saturated market. Their messaging was unclear and failed to attract their target ICP.",
    solution: "We conducted a 3-week brand sprint, defining their core identity, voice, and visual system. This culminated in a new website, sales deck, and GTM messaging framework.",
    outcome: "Achieved 40% increase in qualified leads in the first quarter post-launch. Brand recall in customer surveys improved by 65%.",
    
    galleryImages: [
      "/images/portfolio/client-a-img1.jpg", // e.g., Logo concepts
      "/images/portfolio/client-a-img2.jpg", // e.g., Website before/after
      "/images/portfolio/client-a-img3.jpg"  // e.g., Brand guidelines
    ],
    
    testimonial: {
      text: "The new brand strategy gave us the clarity and confidence we desperately needed. We're finally speaking to the right people, and they're listening.",
      author: "CEO, Client A"
    }
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    clientName: "Client B",
    projectTitle: "Sales Enablement & Messaging",
    thumbnailImage: "/images/portfolio/client-b-thumb.jpg",
    categories: ["Strategy", "Sales"],
    
    challenge: "Client B's sales team was using outdated and inconsistent decks, leading to a 90-day sales cycle and low close rates.",
    solution: "We developed a new core messaging framework and built a modular sales deck in Figma, allowing the team to build custom, high-impact decks in minutes.",
    outcome: "Sales cycle reduced by 30% in the first 6 months. Team-wide adoption of the new materials led to a 15% increase in ACV.",
    
    galleryImages: [
      "/images/portfolio/client-b-img1.jpg", // e.g., Old vs. New deck
      "/images/portfolio/client-b-img2.jpg"  // e.g., Messaging framework
    ],
    
    testimonial: {
      text: "This isn't just a sales deck, it's a new way of selling. Our team finally feels like they have the right tools to win.",
      author: "VP of Sales, Client B"
    }
  }
];
