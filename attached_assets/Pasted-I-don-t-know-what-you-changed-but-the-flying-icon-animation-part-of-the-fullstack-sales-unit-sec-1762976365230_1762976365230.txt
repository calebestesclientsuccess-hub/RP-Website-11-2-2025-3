I don't know what you changed, but the "flying icon" animation, part of the fullstack sales unit section of the homepage is now going to cause headaches and seizures.

It seems that something in their math -- in the physics we gave these objects when we charted their couse in the metaphorical sky -- it seems that the math is broken.

Please make the icons fly, swirl and land in their neat row like Galaga, once again. Prior to your testing, it was working perfectly.

Decided on animation debugging strategy (8 seconds)
I understand there's an issue with the orbital animation causing erratic behavior. Let me investigate what happened to the SimplifiedOrbitalPowers component.

Decided on animation dependency fix (34 seconds)
I found the issue! Looking at the animation code, there's a problematic circular dependency:

The Problem:

Line 234: setOrbitRotation(rotationObj.value) updates state every animation frame (60 times per second)
Line 240: startInitialRotation depends on orbitRotation in its useCallback dependencies
This means startInitialRotation gets recreated 60 times per second during animation
This constant recreation is causing the erratic "seizure-inducing" behavior
The Root Cause:
The startInitialRotation callback shouldn't depend on orbitRotation because it captures a stale value anyway. The animation should always start from the initial rotation value (270), not the current state value.

The Fix:
Remove orbitRotation from the startInitialRotation dependencies and use a fixed starting value. This will make the Galaga-style flight pattern smooth again.

I'll create a task list to fix this:

Decided on animation dependency fix (10 seconds)
I see the problem! The animation callback is being recreated 60 times per second during the animation because of a dependency issue. Let me fix the Galaga-style orbital animation:


Opened client/src/components/SimplifiedOrbitalPowers.tsx

Decided on animation loop fix (4 seconds)
Found it! The issue is on lines 227 and 240. The animation callback depends on orbitRotation state, causing it to recreate 60 times per second. Here's the fix:

Planned workflow restart and testing (4 seconds)
✅ Animation fix applied! The callback no longer recreates during animation. Now testing:

Orbital Animation Smoothness Check

Watch replay














The test for the orbital animation on the home page was successful! The icons fly, swirl, and land nicely in a row without any jerky movements or errors. However, the test on the GTM Engine page couldn't be completed because a floating "Take Assessment" button keeps popping up and blocking clicks on the power icons. This overlay is preventing the test from verifying that the animation and icons work correctly on that page.

Checked animation-related logs (5 seconds)
The test shows the animation is running (icons are present), but there's a floating overlay blocking interactions. Let me check if the animation itself is smooth:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on simpler animation verification (5 seconds)
Good news! The logs show the component hot-reloaded successfully with no GSAP errors. Let me run a simpler test focused just on animation smoothness:

Checking Orbital Animation Smoothness on Homepage

Watch replay







Great news! The animation on the home page looks super smooth and works just as it should. We checked the technical logs and everything is clear – no weird errors popped up, and the icons nicely lined up in a row after about 9 seconds, just like we wanted. The screenshots also confirm the animation flowed perfectly from start to finish.

Decided on task completion steps (4 seconds)
✅ Test passed! The animation is smooth with no erratic behavior. Icons swirl beautifully and land in perfect horizontal alignment. Let me call architect to review the fix:

Decided on animation fix success (4 seconds)
✅ Animation fixed! The Galaga-style orbital flight pattern is smooth again.

What Was Wrong
The startInitialRotation callback had orbitRotation in its dependencies array, causing it to recreate 60 times per second during animation. Every time GSAP updated the rotation (via setOrbitRotation), React created a new callback, leading to unpredictable behavior.

The Fix
Two simple changes:

Line 231: Use fixed starting value { value: 270 } instead of state variable
Line 244: Remove orbitRotation from dependencies [] so callback never recreates
Results
✅ E2E test confirmed smooth animation with no erratic behavior
✅ No GSAP errors in console logs
✅ Icons swirl beautifully and land in perfect horizontal alignment
✅ All 6 power icons present and correctly positioned
✅ Architect approved with Pass verdict
The icons now fly, swirl, and land in their neat row exactly like they did before testing. The animation is smooth and headache-free! 🎮✨
