We could do this a million ways. Please read the plan below, review the codebase, think deeply, and ask yourself, what is the absolute optimal way to move forward, knowing that multitenancy is in the future.

You will understand the goals from the message below; that doesn't mean we will move forward in this exact way. I look to you for wisdom and guidance.

I'll analyze your comprehensive assessment configuration plan and provide architectural guidance for the optimal implementation path, especially considering future multitenancy. Let me first examine your current codebase structure to understand what's already in place.

Planned implementation task list
I'll create a comprehensive implementation task list based on the optimized architecture we discussed. This will give you a clear roadmap to build your configurable assessment platform with multitenancy support from the ground up.

The approach will be to systematically build each layer of the system, starting with the database schema and working up through the backend services, admin UI, and finally the public-facing widget. We'll ensure each phase builds upon the previous one while maintaining backward compatibility with your existing assessments.
