The visualization is a cinematic, scroll-driven animation titled "The Sentient Blueprint." It must be built as a 2D animation using SVG and the GSAP library to ensure high performance and a sharp, technical aesthetic. The goal is to create the feeling of a living, intelligent machine being assembled and powered up on a digital drafting grid.

The narrative is simple but critical: Culture is the ambient energy field that powers the entire GTM machine.

# Visual Breakdown & Assets

Background: The canvas is a dark blueprint grid (e.g., dark navy #2e294e with faint, glowing grid lines). This grid is not static; it should have slowly drifting particles of light in the brand's community blues/purples and competition reds/magentas. This represents the ever-present "Culture Field."

Machine Components: All gears and housings should be designed as clean, precise SVGs. They should have a modern, geometric, or even a subtle "low-poly" style rather than traditional, rounded gear teeth. Their initial state is dark and inert, just outlines on the blueprint.

# The Scroll-Driven Cinematic Journey (GSAP ScrollTrigger)

The entire animation will be pinned and controlled by the user's scroll position. The user must be able to scroll up and down to scrub through the timeline smoothly.

Scene 1: The Blueprint Activates (0-15% Scroll)

The blueprint grid fades into view.

The "Culture Field" particles begin to drift across the screen, establishing the energy source.

The main, empty housing for the GTM engine is "drawn" onto the grid with animated SVG lines.

Scene 2: Elite Talent - Powered by Community (15-40% Scroll)

Energy Flow: Thin, glowing lines of blue and purple light are drawn from the edges of the grid. They converge and flow directly into the "Elite Talent" gear.

Activation: As the energy is absorbed, the gear ignites with a blue/purple glow and begins to slowly rotate. Its satellite components (Coaching, Training, etc.) are drawn around it.

Scene 3: Strategy - Powered by Competition (40-65% Scroll)

Energy Flow: Thin, glowing lines of red and magenta light are drawn from the grid and flow into the "Strategy" gear, which is positioned to mesh with the Talent gear.

Activation: The Strategy gear ignites with a red/magenta glow and begins to rotate in the opposite direction. Its satellite components are drawn.

Scene 4: The System Comes Online (65-85% Scroll)

The "AI" and "Sales Stack" gears are activated in quick succession, each drawing a mix of purple and indigo energy from the grid.

The entire machine is now fully assembled and operational, with all parts rotating in synchronized harmony.

Scene 5: Exploration (85-100% Scroll)

The full GTM Engine is presented. The scroll now allows the user to trigger the "Focus Mode" on the different components.

# Interactivity: "Focus Mode"

This is a critical feature for creating a premium user experience. It must be implemented precisely.

Trigger: On hover over any of the four primary gear systems (Talent, Strategy, AI, Stack).

Action:

The hovered gear system (the primary gear and its satellites) instantly glows brighter and can optionally scale up by 5%. Its rotation continues. A tooltip or text box with its detailed description fades in nearby.

Simultaneously, all other parts of the GTM machine fade to 50% opacity and their rotation slows down significantly (e.g., to 25% of its normal speed).

Reversal: On mouse-out, the machine immediately and smoothly returns to its fully illuminated, synchronized operational state.

This "rack focus" effect is non-negotiable as it directs user attention and makes exploring the machine feel tactical and responsive.
