Based on the "v3" architecture we have just designed and perfected, you have a total of 8 distinct, system-generated prompts and schemas.

We have created a "prompt chain" where each part has a unique, "cinematic" persona and a single, focused job.

Here is the complete inventory of the 8 prompts we have perfected:

1. The Core Chain (4 Prompts)
These are the main prompts that manage the end-to-end generation and review of the entire portfolio.

Prompt 1: The "Artistic Director" (buildPortfolioPrompt)

This is the "v3" master prompt that is "Content-First" and "Dual-Track." It generates the initial portfolio based on the "plentiful vs. sparse" media rules.

Prompt 2: The "Technical Director" (auditPrompt)

This is the "v3" technical linter. It validates the "Dual-Track" output (both Cinematic and Component scenes) and enforces the "Do Not Overdraw" mandate.

Prompt 4: The "Executive Producer" (buildPortfolioCoherencePrompt)

This is the "v3" holistic artistic review. It judges the entire portfolio (including component scenes) for Narrative Arc, Pacing, and Media Strategy.

Prompt 5: The "Technical Enforcer" (responseSchema)

This is the perfected JSON schema that makes the whole system work. It mandates all 37 controls but makes the 5 optional (media/gradient) controls nullable, perfectly solving the "text scene paradox."

2. The "Scene Specialist" Set (4 Prompts)
This is the "Prompt 3" set. These are the specialized "Second Unit Directors" that refine one specific, complex scene type. We have perfected four of them:

buildSplitScenePrompt (v3)

Specialty: Manages "zig-zag" layouts and validates both text and media assets.

buildGalleryScenePrompt (v3)

Specialty: Manages "Do Not Overdraw" by checking the highest index in the asset array and forces the use of staggerChildren.

buildQuoteScenePrompt (v3)

Specialty: Mandates a slow, "contemplative" pace and forces the use of an "Artistic Recipe" (like "Ethereal Dream").

buildFullscreenScenePrompt (v3)

Specialty: Forces the use of "Artistic Recipes" (like "Cinematic Depth") and correctly validates conditional assets (image vs. video).

The "Missing" Prompt
We have one logical prompt remaining to write to complete our "v3" system: the buildComponentScenePrompt. This would be the 5th "Scene Specialist" and the 9th prompt overall, which would be responsible for artistically refining the props of a component scene.
