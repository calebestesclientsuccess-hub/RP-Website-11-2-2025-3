Here is a detailed, screen-by-screen specification of the assessment flow, incorporating your new logic for the calculator and "Person vs. System" concept.

This document describes the flow from a User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) perspective, detailing the logic for each step.

### 📋 Detailed Assessment Flow & UX Specification

**Core UX Principle:** The assessment uses a "one-question-per-screen" layout to maximize focus and completion rates. Progression is automatic upon selection, except where text input is required. A progress bar is visible at all times.

---

### Phase 1: Core Philosophy
* **Progress Bar:** 0%
* **UI:** Each option is presented as a large, clickable "card" or button.

### Backend Sorting Logic (For PDF Generation)
After submission, the system routes the user's data to generate one of the following personalized PDFs based on these triggers:

### Bucket 1: "Hot MQL Architect" (Path 4.A)
* **Triggers:**
    * Q1 = **b. "Own"** AND
    * Q2 = **b. "Consultative"** AND
    * Q3 = **e. "The System (The GTM Engine)"** AND
    * Q11 = **ii. "$8,000+ / month"**
* **PDF Sent:** The "GTM Pod" Blueprint. (High-intent, sales-ready).

### Bucket 2: "Architecture Gap" (Path 4.B)
* **Triggers:**
    * Q1 = **b. "Own"** AND
    * Q2 = **b. "Consultative"** AND
    * Q3 = **e. "The System (The GTM Engine)"** AND
    * Q11 = **i. "< $8,000 / month"**
* **PDF Sent:** The "Architecture Gap" Blueprint. (Nurture-focused, high-value).

### Bucket 3: "The Person Trap" (Path 3)
* **Triggers:**
    * Q3 = **a. "The Person (e.g., a 'star' cold caller)"**
* **Note:** This answer is the primary trigger and overrides other combinations.
* **PDF Sent:** The "$198k Mistake" (Anti-Trap) Blueprint.

### Bucket 4: "Agency" (Path 2)
* **Triggers:**
    * Q1 = **a. "RENT"** AND
    * Q2 = **a. "Transactional"**
* **PDF Sent:** A PDF focused on the "Agency / Black Box Trap".

### Bucket 5: "Freelancer" (Path 1)
* **Triggers:**
    * Q1 = **b. "OWN"** AND
    * Q2 = **a. "Transactional"**
* **PDF Sent:** A PDF focused on "Why Freelancers Fail at Scale".

### Catch-All / Default Bucket
