1. Immediate Task: Critical Database Migration
This initial, critical task stands alone and must be completed before any other phase can begin, as it blocks all user authentication.

Task #1: Critical Database Migration: The objective is to apply the existing but un-applied migration file (0008_add_users_tenant_id.sql). This will add the tenant_id column to the users table, resolving the "column does not exist" error and unblocking the authentication system.

2. Phase 1: Critical A11Y & Security
This phase focuses on establishing the fundamental, non-negotiable foundations for accessibility (A11Y) and security to ensure the application is usable and safe at a baseline level.

Accessibility (A11Y) Tasks
Task #31 (ARIA): Add ARIA labels to all non-text interactive elements (e.g., icon-only buttons, custom widgets).

Task #32 (ARIA): Implement ARIA live regions for dynamically changing content, such as form validation errors, loading states, and success notifications.

Task #33 (ARIA): Add ARIA landmarks (e.g., main, nav, search) to define the page structure for screen readers.

Task #34 (ARIA): Implement proper ARIA roles for all custom components (e.g., accordions, modals, tabs).

Task #35 (Keyboard): Ensure comprehensive keyboard navigation, including optimizing the tab order and adding "skip navigation" links.

Task #36 (Keyboard): Add highly visible focus indicators to all interactive elements.

Task #37 (Keyboard): Implement and document keyboard shortcuts for power users.

Task #38 (Screen Reader): Add descriptive alt text for all meaningful images and mark decorative images as such.

Task #39 (Screen Reader): Implement a proper, logical heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) with no skipped levels.

Task #40 (Screen Reader): Add screen reader-only announcements for important state changes (e.g., form submitted, page loaded).

Task #41 (Contrast): Ensure all text and UI components meet WCAG AA color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI).

Task #42 (Contrast): Add support for high-contrast modes.

Task #43 (Contrast): Ensure information is not conveyed by color alone (e.g., use icons or text labels alongside color).

Security Tasks
Task #21 (Input Validation): Implement server-side sanitization for all user inputs, especially rich text, to prevent XSS and SQL injection.

Task #22 (Input Validation): Add robust file upload validation, including file type verification (not just extension), size limits, and malware scanning.

Task #23 (Auth): Implement an automatic session timeout mechanism after a period of inactivity.

Task #24 (Auth): Enforce password strength requirements (complexity rules, common password blacklist, strength meter).

Task #25 (Auth): Implement an account lockout mechanism after a configurable number of failed login attempts.

3. Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure
This phase is dedicated to building the complete testing and quality assurance framework. The goal is to establish the automated processes needed to verify all current and future work.

Task #5 (Unit Tests): Create unit tests for core utility functions (e.g., seo-utils.ts, decisionTreeUtils.ts, assessment-scoring.ts).

Task #6 (Unit Tests): Create unit tests for all data transformation logic (e.g., campaign filtering, portfolio processing).

Task #7 (Integration Tests): Create integration tests for all primary API endpoints (e.g., lead submission, auth flows, admin CRUD).

Task #8 (Integration Tests): Create integration tests specifically for database operations, verifying multi-tenant data isolation and complex transactions.

Task #9 (E2E Tests): Create end-to-end (E2E) tests for critical user journeys (e.g., completing an assessment, submitting a lead, publishing a blog post).

Task #10 (E2E Tests): Create E2E tests specifically for multi-tenant scenarios to verify tenant isolation and prevent cross-tenant data access.

Task #11 (Infrastructure): Set up the complete testing framework (Vitest, Playwright), configure a dedicated test database, and automate this entire suite in a CI/CD pipeline.

4. Phase 3: UI/UX Polish
With the foundations for stability and A11Y in place, this phase focuses on refining the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) for better usability, mobile optimization, and user feedback.

Task #12 (Mobile): Optimize all touch targets to be a minimum of 44x44px with proper spacing.

Task #13 (Mobile): Improve the mobile navigation experience with better menu animations and clearer active state indicators.

Task #14 (Mobile): Optimize mobile form interactions, including better keyboard handling and auto-advancing fields where appropriate.

Task #15 (Loading): Add skeleton loaders for all primary content areas (e.g., blog posts, assessment, portfolio).

Task #16 (Errors): Improve error state messaging to be more contextual, offer recovery suggestions, and have a clearer visual hierarchy.

Task #17 (Performance): Implement progressive image loading (e.g., blur-up effect, LQIP) to improve perceived load time.

Task #18 (Performance): Optimize font loading strategy (e.g., subsetting, preloading) to prevent layout shifts and invisible text.

Task #19 (Feedback): Add clear success confirmations (e.g., visual feedback, animations) for all user actions and form submissions.

Task #20 (Feedback): Improve form validation with real-time, inline validation and clear, field-level error messaging.

5. Phase 4: Advanced A11Y & Security
This phase builds on the foundations from Phase 1, implementing more advanced and comprehensive features for accessibility and security hardening.

Accessibility (A11Y) Tasks
Task #44 (Forms): Ensure all form inputs have properly associated labels, descriptions (using aria-describedby), and required field indicators.

Task #45 (Forms): Implement correct autocomplete attributes for all forms to support browser autofill (e.g., addresses, payment info).

Task #46 (Forms): Add error prevention and recovery mechanisms, such as confirmation dialogs for destructive actions and "undo" functionality.

Task #47 (Media): Add captions or subtitles (e.g., WebVTT files) for all video content.

Task #48 (Media): Provide full, searchable transcripts for all audio and video content.

Task #49 (Media): Implement audio descriptions for video content where visual information is not conveyed by audio.

Task #50 (Testing): Implement automated accessibility testing (e.g., Axe-core, Lighthouse CI) into the pipeline.

Task #51 (Testing): Conduct manual testing using actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

Task #52 (Docs): Create and publish accessibility documentation, such as a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) and a keyboard shortcuts guide.

Security Tasks
Task #26 (API): Implement a mechanism for API key rotation, including automated rotation and key usage tracking.

Task #27 (API): Implement request signing (e.g., HMAC signatures) for highly sensitive API operations to prevent replay attacks.

Task #28 (Monitoring): Add comprehensive security event logging (e.g., failed logins, privilege escalation attempts).

Task #29 (Monitoring): Implement an intrusion detection system (e.g., rate limiting per IP, automated blocking of suspicious IPs).

Task #30 (Monitoring): Create and document a formal security incident response plan.

6. Phase 5: Performance Monitoring
The final phase focuses on implementing systems to monitor, measure, and enforce application performance and SEO health on an ongoing basis.

Task #53 (SEO): Implement contextual internal linking within blog posts, using automated suggestions and manual insertion.

Task #54 (SEO): Add related content recommendation sections to pages based on content similarity algorithms.

Task #55 (Monitoring): Integrate Lighthouse CI into the pipeline for automated performance testing and regression alerts.

Task #56 (Monitoring): Implement Core Web Vitals (CWV) tracking using Real User Monitoring (RUM) to measure LCP, FID, and CLS.

Task #57 (Monitoring): Define and enforce performance budgets (e.g., bundle size limits, load time thresholds) in the CI/CD pipeline.

Note on Unassigned Tasks
Based on the "Recommended Implementation Order" you provided, I have mapped all 54 items assigned to the 6 phases. Please note that the following 3 tasks from the original 57-item list were not assigned to any of these specific phases:

(Category 6) Add database indexes for performance

(Category 6) Database connection pooling optimization

(Category 6) Add database backup automation

These are important database enhancements that you may want to assign to one of the existing phases or address separately.
