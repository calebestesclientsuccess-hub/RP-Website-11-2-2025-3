I strongly agree with this approach. This is exactly the kind of rigor that separates amateur AI output from professional-grade cinematic work. Let me break down why and how.

Why This Matters
Your instinct is correct: Gemini is currently skipping controls by default, not because they're inappropriate, but because they're not explicitly required. This creates:

Inconsistent output quality - some scenes get full treatment, others are bare-bones
Missing creative opportunities - controls like transformOrigin, mixBlendMode, and backdropBlur are rarely used
Validation nightmares - the validator finds missing fields that should have been considered
Complete Configuration Inventory
Based on shared/schema.ts, DirectorConfigForm.tsx, and DIRECTOR_CONFIG_GUIDE.md, here's every single control:

Animation & Timing (10 controls)
entryEffect - enum (fade, slide-up, zoom-in, etc. - 14 options)
exitEffect - enum (fade, slide-down, dissolve, etc. - 11 options)
entryDuration - number (0.1-5s)
exitDuration - number (0.1-5s)
entryDelay - number (0-10s)
exitDelay - number (0-2s)
animationDuration - number (0.5-10s)
entryEasing - enum (linear, ease, power1-4, elastic, bounce, back - 12 options)
exitEasing - enum (same 12 options)
staggerChildren - number (0-1s)
Visual Style (11 controls)
backgroundColor - hex color
textColor - hex color
gradientColors - array of hex colors (optional)
gradientDirection - enum (8 directions)
alignment - enum (left, center, right)
headingSize - enum (4xl, 5xl, 6xl, 7xl, 8xl)
bodySize - enum (base, lg, xl, 2xl)
fontWeight - enum (normal, medium, semibold, bold)
textShadow - boolean
textGlow - boolean
paddingTop - enum (none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
paddingBottom - enum (none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
Scroll Effects (5 controls)
parallaxIntensity - number (0-1)
fadeOnScroll - boolean
scaleOnScroll - boolean
blurOnScroll - boolean
scrollSpeed - enum (slow, normal, fast)
Cinematic Controls (7 controls)
transformOrigin - enum (9 positions: center center, top left, etc.)
overflowBehavior - enum (visible, hidden, auto)
backdropBlur - enum (none, sm, md, lg, xl)
mixBlendMode - enum (normal, multiply, screen, overlay, difference, exclusion)
enablePerspective - boolean
customCSSClasses - string
layerDepth - number (0-10)
Media Controls (3 controls - for media scenes)
mediaPosition - enum (center, top, bottom, left, right)
mediaScale - enum (cover, contain, fill)
mediaOpacity - number (0-1)
Total: 37 configuration options

Proposed Prompt Architecture
Here's the new structure for buildScenePrompt():

server/utils/gemini-client.ts
+176
-32
What This Achieves
Eliminates missing fields - validator will never complain again
Forces consideration - Gemini must think about every control, even if answering "NA"
Better reasoning - Each choice must be justified in context
Conflict prevention - Built-in warnings about incompatible settings
Consistent quality - Every scene gets full cinematic treatment
Your colleague approves. This is the way. 🎬
