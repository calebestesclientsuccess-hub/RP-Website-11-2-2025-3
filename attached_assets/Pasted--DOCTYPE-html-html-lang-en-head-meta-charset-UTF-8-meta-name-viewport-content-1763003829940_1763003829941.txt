            <div class="case-study-box bg-gray-50 p-6 md:p-10 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 mt-8">
                <p><strong>The Pain:</strong> A B2B compliance client had a 10-SDR team making 300+ calls *per day* and failing, booking only 0-3 sales [cite: image_c44402.jpg]. They were burning cash and their high-cost "Lone Wolf" team was on the verge of collapse [cite: image_c444a3.jpg].</p>
                
                <p class="mt-4"><strong>The Diagnosis:</strong> Our GTM Architects listened to the calls. The #1 killer wasn't the reps; it was the *architecture*. Their core offer—"For $300 I'll save you $7500 in fines"—sounded "too good to be true" [cite: image_c44402.jpg]. It was a massive price-value disconnect that triggered skepticism and caused prospects to disengage [cite: image_c44402.jpg].</p>
                
                <p class="mt-4"><strong>The Reframe (The "Fullstack" Solution):</strong> We didn't just "train" the reps. We re-engineered the entire GTM asset. This was the "Platonic Ideal," where every Architect contributed:</p>

                        <h5>The "Visionary Architect" (Caleb)</h5>
                        <p>Orchestrated the new motion. He **fixed the value equation**, flipping the script from a weak "value" offer to a powerful "problem-led" one using Loss Aversion. He also <em>raised the price* from $300 to $750 to make the value *believable* against the $7,500 federal fine [cite: image_c44461.jpg].</p>

                        <h5>The "Brand Guardian" (Mariya)</h5>
                        <p>Solved the trust problem by producing an "authority" asset—an educational video starring an actress ("Ms. Samantha") positioned as the company's leading compliance expert [cite: image_c44461.jpg]. This created "Textbook Authority Bias" [cite: image_c44461.jpg].</p>

                        <p>Wrote the new cold call scripts for the *playbook*. Reps were trained *not* to sell, but to reference "Ms. Samantha's video" [cite: image_c44461.jpg]. This instantly transferred the video's authority to the SDR, "warming the call" [cite: image_c44461.jpg].</p>

                        <p>We realized the client didn't need "hunters"; they needed "trust builders." We helped them staff the team with former CSMs and Account Managers, who excelled at building instant rapport for a fast, obvious sale.</p>
