To: Lead Engineer From: CTO & Product Officer Subject: Project Onboarding: Foundational Codebase Audit & Engineering Charter

Welcome to the team.

Your first and most critical task is to conduct a comprehensive, read-only audit of our entire application.

Your analysis will form the foundation for all subsequent development, refactoring, and feature work. The goal is to eliminate the "shallow answers" and establish a deep, shared understanding of the codebase's current state and strategic goals.

This isn't just a bug hunt. You are to produce our 'Engineering Charter'—a foundational document that will govern all future engineering and product decisions in this thread.

Part 1: The Business & Product Context
Before any analysis, internalize our mission. All your recommendations must align with these two directives.

Product Purpose: [e.g., "This is a B2B SaaS platform for managing sales pipelines and automating GTM motions."]

Strategic Business Plan: [e.g., "Our 18-month roadmap includes a pivot to a multi-tenant architecture. We are not building it now, but all current and future engineering work must actively prepare for this pivot. We cannot afford to refactor our entire-app logic when the time comes."]

Part 2: Current-State Technical Audit
We have immediate concerns that are impacting user experience and our GTM (Go-to-Market) strategy. We need a full baseline report.

Performance & UX Audit: The whole thing looks beautiful, but it's not running well. We're experiencing janky movement and inconsistent animation.

Action: Conduct a full audit of all animations, paying special attention to the "fullstack sales unit 'flying icon'" animation.

Deliverable: A report identifying the root causes of all jank, layout shifts, and performance bottlenecks.

GTM / SEO Audit: Our product's discoverability is key. We need to know where we stand.

Action: Conduct a comprehensive audit of the current state of our technical SEO implementation.

Deliverable: A "State of SEO" report.

Part 3: Future-State & Architectural Analysis
This is the CTO's primary concern. We must build for the future, not just for today.

Multi-Tenancy Readiness (Research Question):

Action: Based on our strategic plan (Part 1, Point 2), answer this research question: How much of the work to support multi-tenancy have we already completed?

Deliverable: A report answering (a) What, if anything, will have to be redone? and (b) What new architectural rules must we follow starting today to continue preparing for this?

Latent Feature Audit (CMS/CRM):

Action: The codebase contains significant CMS and CRM features that are not yet exposed to the UI (e.g., the global styling logic).

Deliverable: An audit of these "hidden" features, assessing their readiness to be exposed and any dependencies we need to be aware of.

Final Deliverable: The 'Engineering Charter'
Once your 7-part analysis is complete, you will synthesize all findings into a single, comprehensive markdown file: ENGINEERING_CHARTER.md.

This document will be our single source of truth and must include:

A high-level summary of the app's condition (Code Health, Performance, Architectural Readiness).

A list of all identified technical debt and immediate performance risks.

The "Developer's Rulebook": A complete, consolidated list of all rules—synthesized from your findings—that we (you and I) must follow for all future work. This must include:

The "SEO Rulebook" (Your original Point 4)

The "Performance & Animation Rulebook"

The "Multi-Tenancy Rulebook"

This foundational work is critical. We are trusting you to go deep and set the architectural standard for this entire project.

We look forward to your analysis.
