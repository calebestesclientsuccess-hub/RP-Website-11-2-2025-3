Brother, you are 100% correct. My apologies.

I built the structure of the "Master Plan" but failed to provide the most critical part: the soul. The actual diagnostic content for the four paths.

You're right. The "Master Implementation Prompt" is still incomplete without the exact, final, 10th-grade-level, HBR-quality copy for those results pages.

Here is the complete, final diagnostic and action plan content for all four paths. This is the missing "software" for the machine, ready for Replit to copy and paste.

This is the real Appendix C.

Appendix C (Complete): Diagnostic & Action Plan Content for All 4 Results Pages
PATH 1: THE "COMMODITY" PATH (GtmResultPath1.tsx)
(Trigger: Q1 = A: "Simple Value Prop")

[DYNAMIC READOUT CARD COMPONENT] YOUR GTM DIAGNOSTIC: [ICON] COMPLEXITY: Simple Value Prop [ICON] BUDGET: N/A [ICON] DIAGNOSIS: Path 1 - The "Commodity" Path

H2: The Diagnosis: Your GTM Path is the "Activity" Model

Based on your "Simple Value Prop," your sales process is straightforward. You don't need a complex, consultative sales team to explore "unacknowledged risk"—you just need more high-quality at-bats.

Your primary goal is *activity*, not architecture. A traditional "Commodity" Agency or a skilled "Gig Marketplace" freelancer is a 100% valid path for you. Our full "GTM Architecture" model would be overkill.

H2: Your Action Plan

Your most important step is to find a trusted, high-volume vendor that can represent your brand professionally. This is all about finding a reliable partner, not building a complex internal system.

We've reviewed the top players in this space. We're happy to point you in the right direction.

PATH 2: THE "DIY / INTERNAL TRAP" PATH (GtmResultPath2.tsx)
(Trigger: Q1 = B: "Complex Value Prop" AND Q2 = A: "Low Budget")

[DYNAMIC READOUT CARD COMPONENT] YOUR GTM DIAGNOSTIC: [ICON] COMPLEXITY: Complex Value Prop [ICON] BUDGET: <$5,000 / month [ICON] DIAGNOSIS: Path 2 - The "DIY Architect" Path

H2: The Diagnosis: You Are in the "DIY Architect" Path

You have a "Complexity" Problem. Your consultative sale means commodity agencies *will fail*. They are not built to challenge prospects, differentiate complex value, or navigate multi-threaded deals. They are built for "activity," and you need "architecture."

Because you are on a tight budget, you are in the toughest, most common position for a founder. You are forced to build this system yourself.

H2: Your Action Plan

You must avoid the **"$198,000 Mistake"** at all costs. This is the trap of hiring a single "Lone Wolf" rep and expecting them to be an expert in list-building, tech, *and* strategy. This is a gamble, not a plan.

Your job is not "Head of Sales"; your job is "GTM Architect." You must build the *system* (the plays, the tech, the metrics) *before* you hire the person. We've written the survival guide for you.

PATH 3: THE "GTM ARCHITECTURE" PATH (GtmResultPath3.tsx)
(Trigger: Q1 = B: "Complex Value Prop" AND Q2 = B: "Target Budget")

[DYNAMIC READOUT CARD COMPONENT] YOUR GTM DIAGNOSTIC: [ICON] COMPLEXITY: Complex Value Prop [ICON] BUDGET: $5,000 - $15,000 / month [ICON] DIAGNOSIS: Path 3 - The "GTM Architecture" Path

H2: The Diagnosis: You Are in the "GTM Architecture" Zone

You are in the perfect position to scale. You have a "Complex Value Prop" that needs a real system, *and* you have a realistic budget to build one.

This also makes you the #1 target for the two biggest traps:

The "Lone Wolf Trap": Hiring an internal rep and falling into the "$198,000 Mistake."

The "Black Box Trap": Renting a commodity agency that will fail to sell your complex solution.

You are ready to stop "renting" a service and start *building an asset*.

H2: Your Action Plan

Your path is to deploy a complete GTM Revenue Engine (people, tech, and strategy) that **you own**. This is the "architecture-first" model. It's the only way to get the consultative, expert-level sales development you need without the 9-month ramp time and six-figure risk of a new hire.

When you're ready to scale, we hand you the keys, and you can hire an internal team to run the *system* we built for you.

PATH 4: THE "ENTERPRISE / BUILD VS. BUY" PATH (GtmResultPath4.tsx)
(Trigger: Q1 = B: "Complex Value Prop" AND Q2 = C: "Enterprise Budget")

[DYNAMIC READOUT CARD COMPONENT] YOUR GTM DIAGNOSTIC: [ICON] COMPLEXITY: Complex Value Prop [ICON] BUDGET: $15,000+ / month [ICON] DIAGNOSIS: Path 4 - The "Build vs. Buy" Path

H2: The Diagnosis: You Are in the "Build vs. Buy" Path

You have the "Complex Value Prop" *and* the capital to build a full internal GTM Architecture. You can afford to hire the 5 SDRs, 2 AEs, Coach, RevOps team, and CRO yourself.

This is the classic "Build vs. Buy" decision. The "Internal Build" gives you 100% control, but it's a 9-month, high-cost, high-risk project. The "Deploy" model gives you a complete, managed GTM Architecture in 14 days for a fraction of the cost.

H2: Your Action Plan

Your choice is not *what* to build, but *how*. You can either spend $15k+/mo *plus* 9 months of ramp time and management overhead to "Build It"...

...*or* you can "Deploy It" with our "GTM-as-a-Service" model. We build your entire revenue engine as an asset you own, managed for you, at a fraction of the cost and time. It's the capital-efficient path to the exact same outcome.
