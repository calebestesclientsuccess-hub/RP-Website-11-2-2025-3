Here is the prompt for Replit, designed to align both calculators and ensure maximum clarity for an executive-level audience.

**Subject: Final Executive Alignment for Both ROI Calculators (Copy & Logic)**

**Goal:** This is the final polish. The goal is to align the terminology on *both* the simple (hero) calculator and the full-page "deeper dive" calculator. All changes are designed to make the tools perfectly clear, credible, and consistent for an executive audience.

---

### Task 1: Standardize All Terminology (Apply Everywhere)

This is the most critical task. We must standardize these terms across *both* calculator pages, the email reports, and any share dialogs.

1.  **Input Label:**
    * **Change From:** `New Client Value` (or `Your Client Value`)
    * **Change To:** `Average LTV`

2.  **Output Labels:**
    * **Change From:** `Additional Monthly Revenue` (or `Projected New LTV Booked Per Month`)
    * **Change To:** `New Revenue Booked Per Month`

3.  **Annual Output Labels:**
    * **Change From:** `Additional Annual Revenue` (or `Projected New LTV Booked Per Year`)
    * **Change To:** `New Revenue Booked Per Year`

### Task 2: Add LTV Definition (Tooltip)

To give "Average LTV" clear context, add a `(?)` icon next to the `Average LTV` label on both calculator pages. On hover, it should display the following info box:

> **Based on a $5K/mo Client**
>
> Our default LTV of $120,000 imagines an average client value of $5,000 MRR over a 24-month lifetime. Adjust the slider to match your company's average LTV.

### Task 3: Fix Full-Page Calculator Logic Bug

On the full-page ("deeper dive") calculator, fix the display bug from the last review:

* **The Bug:** The "Monthly Guaranteed SQOs" output card (in "The Results") does not update when a new "GTM Engine" is selected. It stays at "20.0".
* **The Fix:** Make this card dynamic. When a user selects the "2-SDR GTM Pod" (which guarantees 40 SQOs), the "Monthly Guaranteed SQOs" card must update to display "40.0".

### Final Verification Checklist

Please verify these key items remain true:

* The "40x+ ROI" headline is still present and correct based on the default values.
* The 11-month annual calculation (`Monthly * 11`) is working.
* The `*December excluded for training` disclaimer is present and italicized under the annual figures.
