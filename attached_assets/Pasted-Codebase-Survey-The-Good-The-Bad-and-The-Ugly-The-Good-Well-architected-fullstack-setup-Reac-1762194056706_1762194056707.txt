Codebase Survey: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
The Good:
✅ Well-architected fullstack setup - React (Vite), Tailwind, Express, Drizzle ORM all properly configured
✅ Existing assessment infrastructure - Already has an assessment page with multi-step forms and lead capture
✅ Clean routing with Wouter - URL-based state management will work perfectly for our needs
✅ Proper form validation - React-hook-form + Zod already integrated
✅ Database ready - Existing emailCaptures and leadCaptures tables we can extend
✅ Resource pages pattern established - /resources/ directory structure already in place
✅ Component library ready - Full shadcn/ui components available

The Bad:
⚠️ Conflicting assessment - Existing AssessmentPage is a 7-question GTM readiness tool (different purpose)
⚠️ No email templating - Currently just returns success messages, no actual email sending
⚠️ Schema updates needed - Need to add fields for path, q1, q2 tracking

The Ugly:
🔥 Namespace collision risk - Must carefully name our new assessment to avoid conflicts
🔥 No analytics infrastructure - Will need to build tracking from scratch
🔥 Complex state flow - 4 different paths with different CTAs and nurture sequences

Plan for Creating the Task List
Given the complexity, I'll structure this as a 5-phase implementation:

Phase 1: Foundation (Database & Backend)
Extend schema for GTM assessment tracking
Create new API endpoints for blueprint capture
Set up email template system
Phase 2: Content Pages (The "Room")
Build the Trojan Horse article page
Implement SEO optimizations
Phase 3: Assessment Engine (The "Machine")
Create the 2-question diagnostic tool
Implement URL-based routing logic
Build the diagnostic readout component
Phase 4: Conversion System (The "Commitment Staircase")
Create 4 results pages with unique content
Build lead capture forms
Implement dynamic CTAs
Phase 5: Enhancements & Polish
Add Path 1 newsletter nurture
Balance Path 2 messaging
Add proof points to Paths 3-4
Implement analytics tracking
Build email nurture sequences
Implementation Plan with All Enhancements
I'll build a sophisticated GTM diagnostic tool that segments prospects into 4 paths based on their value proposition complexity and budget. This will include:

A "Trojan Horse" SEO article about hiring cold callers that drives traffic to the assessment
A 2-question decision tree that routes users to personalized results
4 distinct results pages with tailored diagnosis, action plans, and CTAs
Smart lead capture with path-specific blueprints and nurture sequences
Advanced analytics to track conversion through the funnel
The enhancements will ensure even "disqualified" prospects get value, fear-based messaging is balanced with support, and conversion is maximized with proof points and progressive CTAs.

Revised task list. (11 seconds)
Yes, this additional context is very helpful! Based on what I see from the previous conversation, I should reconsider a few things:

Key Learnings:
You already have the diagnostic content - The complete copy for all 4 result paths is provided in your first attachment. I don't need to create placeholder diagnostic content.

Lorem ipsum is fine for article bodies - You've explicitly said to use placeholder text for the article content while keeping the real titles and structure.

The infrastructure is the priority - The focus should be on building a fully functional assessment tool that works end-to-end, not on perfecting copy.

Email service consideration - The previous assistant noted there's no email service configured. We should plan for this but can start with storing the data and adding email later.

Updated Approach:
Let me revise the task list to be more accurate and implementation-focused:
