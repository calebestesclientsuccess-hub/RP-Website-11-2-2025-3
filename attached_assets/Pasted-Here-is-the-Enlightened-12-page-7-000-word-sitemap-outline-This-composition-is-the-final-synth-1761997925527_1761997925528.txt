Here is the "Enlightened" 12-page, 7,000+ word sitemap outline.

This composition is the final synthesis of all our inputs:
1.  **The "Voice of God" (VoG) Content Plan:** The 60-article, 5-theme, 4-architect narrative universe [cite: 12455-14227].
2.  **The Commercial Model:** The `4-Month "Build & Ramp"` term, the `Month 5 Guarantee` (`20+ SQOs/SDR`), and the `90-Day Rolling Terms`.
3.  **The Product Brand:** The "iPhone vs. phone" analogy, where "GTM Engine" is the category and **"The Fullstack Sales Unit"** is the branded product.
4.  **The Tone:** "Empathy-Driven Deconstruction." We are bold, forensic, and contrarian, but we attack the *system*, not the user. We validate their pain and reframe "mistakes" as "traps."
5.  **The "Enlightened" Homepage Flow:** The hybrid model we co-developed, blending your product-forward flow with my plan's "forensic" and "interactive ROI" modules.

This is the **"Risk-Mitigation Engine"** blueprint, designed to be a copy-first, component-level document for your React developers.

    * "B2B leaders are told they have two choices for building pipeline: hire internally or outsource to an agency."
    * "What they aren't told is that both of these models are fundamentally broken. They are two paths to the same destination: a burned-out team, a non-existent pipeline, and a GTM strategy with zero long-term assets."
    * "This is the False Dichotomy: a choice between a $198,000 gamble or a $120,000 guaranteed loss. Both are built on *unmitigated risk*."

* **H3 (The Forensic Proof):** `The Financial Equation of an F-Level System`
* **Body:** "The $198k isn't an exaggeration; it's a calculation from our 'Evidence Spine' [cite: 13917-13936]. It's the sum of four systemic failures you are forced to pay:"
    * **Bullet 1: `$50,000 Ramp Burn`**
        * "The cost of a **3.1-month ramp** (not 6-9), which isn't 'training time'; it's 'architecture-building time' you're forcing the rep to do [cite: 14216]."
    * **Bullet 2: `$27,000 Management Tax`**
        * "The hidden cost of *your* high-leverage time (or your manager's) spent on low-leverage, 1:1 supervision for an unsupported rep [cite: 14213]."

    * "You're tired of the $198k risk, so you sign a 12-month contract with a commodity `b2b appointment setting service`. This is the 'Lone Wolf Suicide Mission' (VoG Theme 2) [cite: 11776]."
* **H3:** `The "Activity Mirage" (The 93% Failure)`
    * **Body:** "This is the lie of 'Activity' [cite: 12613]. You are sold a dashboard of 'dials' and 'emails', but this 'Activity Theater' produces $0 in real pipeline. This is why **93% of these agencies fail** [cite: 13735]."
* **H3:** `The "Black Box Problem" (The Intercept)`
    * **Body:** "You have no idea *how* they're getting meetings. You can't see the data. This is the model used by commodity firms like **Belkins**. You're flying blind."
* **H3:** `The "Zero-IP Trap" (The Catastrophe)`
    * **Body:** "This is the most dangerous trap [cite: 12642]. After 12 months, you fire the agency. What do you have to show for it? **Nothing.** They leave and take 100% of the IP, the learnings, and the playbooks with them. You are left with zero assets. You didn't build *your* company; you built *theirs*."

**[The Diagnosis Module - "The Reframe"]**

* **Body Content:**
    * "The 'Lone Wolf' hire (the $198k gamble) and the 'Black Box' agency (the $120k guaranteed loss) are just symptoms. The disease is a broken GTM *architecture*."

**[FAQ Section 1: The Engagement & Guarantee]**
* **H2:** `Section 1: The Guarantee & Pricing`
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 1]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: What is the guarantee, *exactly*?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "From Month 5 on, we guarantee `20+` qualified 'shown' appointments *per SDR*, per month (excluding December). For the 2-SDR Pod, that's `40+` total meetings. These meetings will meet the specific ICP and BANT criteria we agree upon in your GTM Audit. **If we miss this quota, we work for free until we hit it.**"
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 2]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: Why the 4-month initial term?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "Because we are building a *permanent system*, not just renting a person. Months 1-4 are the 'Build & Ramp' (Audit, Build, Test, Optimize). This process is what *enables* us to give you the guarantee from Month 5 onwards. Cheap agencies skip this, which is why they fail (a 93% failure rate) [cite: 13735]."
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 3]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: Why is the 2-SDR Pod ($15k) only $2.5k more than the 1-SDR ($12.5k)?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "It's our 'no-brainer' offer. We want you to succeed, and the 'Pod' model (Community + Competition) [cite: 13953] is our most effective. We discount the second SDR to make it the obvious choice, as it drops your effective cost-per-SDR (to $7.5k/SDR) and your cost-per-meeting to **$375**. It's the highest ROI on the site."

**[FAQ Section 2: The "Asset" & "Risk"]**
* **H2:** `Section 2: The Asset, Risk & IP`
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 1]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: What happens if my SDR leaves? This is my biggest fear.`
    * **Body (Answer):** "**Nothing.** Your pipeline is safe. This is the core of our value. With an internal 'Lone Wolf' hire, your pipeline crashes for 6-9 months (The '$198k Liability'). With us, the 'asset' (the 'Impact Selling OS' and 'Signal Factory') remains. We slot in a new, pre-trained 'Impact' certified operator, and they are productive almost immediately. You are investing in a resilient *system*, not a fragile *person*."
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 2]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: Can I take this in-house later?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "**Yes.** We are a white-labeled "build-operate-transfer" partner. We *want* you to own this asset. When you're ready, we'll help you hire and train your own team to run the *proven, guaranteed system we built for you*."
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 3]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: What does "owning the playbook" actually mean?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "It means the 'Impact Selling OS'—all messaging, objection handling, personas, and playbooks—is built for you, in a shared document, and is **100% your IP forever**. This is the 'brain' of your sales engine. You can take it and leave at any time (after your term), and you will not be a victim of the 'Zero-IP Trap' [cite: 12642]."

**[FAQ Section 3: The "Competition"]**
* **H2:** `Section 3: The Competition`
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 1]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: How is this different from Belkins, Upwork, or a traditional agency?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "It's the difference between renting a liability and building an asset.
        * **`Upwork / Internal Hire`** is a **risk**. You pay $198k+ for a *person* who has a 34% chance of failing [cite: 14219], guarantees 0, and creates a single point of failure.
        * **`Belkins / Agencies`** are a **trap**. They are a 'Black Box' that rents you 'activity' with no guarantee and no IP. You build *their* asset, not yours.
        * **`Revenue Party`** is a **guaranteed asset**. You are buying a resilient *system*, 100% IP ownership, and a *guaranteed* 20+ SQOs/SDR for a fixed price."
* **[Accordion/Toggle Component 2]:**
    * **H3 (Question):** `Q: What's *not* included?`
    * **Body (Answer):** "We are a strategic GTM Engine, not a commodity service. We do *not* do:
        * **Closing:** Our BDR Pods are elite opportunity-generators. Your team handles the close.
        * **Inbound Marketing:** We are not a content/SEO agency (though our 'Signal Factory' *uses* your inbound leads).
        * **One-Off 'Projects':** We do not do '1-month call-down' projects. We are building a permanent, scalable revenue system, not a temporary 'activity' boost."
