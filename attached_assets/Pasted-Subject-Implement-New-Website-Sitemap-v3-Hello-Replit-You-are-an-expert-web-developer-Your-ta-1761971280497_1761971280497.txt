Subject: Implement New Website Sitemap (v3)

Hello Replit,

You are an expert web developer. Your task is to update my existing website to implement a brand new sitemap.

Here is the goal:
We are restructuring the entire site based on the sitemap (v3) provided. This involves updating all navigation, deleting old pages, and creating new placeholder pages.

Please follow these steps exactly:

1. Update Primary Navigation (Header):

Locate the main header navigation menu.

Delete all existing navigation links.

Add the following new links in this specific order:

The Problem (href: /problem)

The GTM Engine (href: /gtm-engine)

Results & Case Studies (href: /results)

Why Revenue Party? (href: /why-us)

Blog / Resources (href: /blog)

Schedule GTM Audit (as a styled button, href: /audit)

2. Update Footer Navigation:

Locate the footer navigation/sitemap area.

Ensure the following links are present (add any that are missing, and remove any old ones):

The Problem (href: /problem)

The GTM Engine (href: /gtm-engine)

Results & Case Studies (href: /results)

Why Revenue Party? (href: /why-us)

Blog / Resources (href: /blog)

ROI Calculator (href: /roi-calculator)

GTM Readiness Assessment (href: /assessment)

Pricing & Engagement (href: /pricing)

FAQ (href: /faq)

Contact Us / Careers (href: /contact)

3. Purge/Create Pages:

Home Page (/):

DO NOT DELETE the content on the Home Page.

Go through the Home Page content and update all internal links to point to the new URLs (e.g., the "The Problem" section should link to /problem, "The Solution" to /gtm-engine, etc.).

All Other Pages (New & Old):

Delete any old pages that are not in the new sitemap (e.g., "Solutions," "Methodology," "Blueprints," etc. if they exist).

Create the following new pages.

For each new page, add only a simple <h1> title as placeholder content.

Crucially, delete all other body content from any old pages that are being repurposed. We want blank slates for all pages except the Home Page.

New Page Placeholders:

/problem -> <h1>The Problem ("The Lone Wolf Trap")</h1>

/gtm-engine -> <h1>The GTM Engine</h1>

/results -> <h1>Results & Case Studies ("The Proof")</h1>

/why-us -> <h1>Why Revenue Party? ("Why Us?")</h1>

/blog -> <h1>Blog / Resources ("The Pillar Page")</h1>

/audit -> <h1>Schedule GTM Audit</h1> (Note: This page should contain the Calendly/form embed)

/roi-calculator -> <h1>ROI Calculator</h1> (Note: This page should contain the calculator tool)

/assessment -> <h1>GTM Readiness Assessment</h1> (Note: This page will contain the quiz)

/contact -> <h1>Contact Us / Careers</h1>

/pricing -> <h1>Pricing & Engagement</h1>

/faq -> <h1>FAQ</h1>

Please confirm once you have completed this site-wide restructuring.
